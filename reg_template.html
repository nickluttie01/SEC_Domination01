		<p> It just means more. That’s the slogan of the Southeastern Conference, better known as the SEC. For many years now, this conference has dominated the landscape of college athletics. But not too long ago it wasn’t like this. In fact, in 2013 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2013/01/16/the-most-valuable-conferences-in-college-sports/?sh=448744ee6b9c"> Forbes placed the SEC as the fourth most valuable conference in college sports.</a> Leading the way were the Big Ten, Pac-12 and ACC. </p>
		<p>But how would that be possible? At that time, the SEC had won the last seven national championships in football. Well, believe it or not, it’s far more complicated than just wins and loses. As Chris Smith of Forbes explains in his article, TV money is the biggest facet when determining a conference's value.  </p>
		<p>“…Television revenue is essentially the sole driving factor in conference value,” Smith said. “While income from bowl games and basketball tournaments has been relegated to a rounding error.”</p>
		<p>So, what changed? How did the SEC get to where they are today? In case you didn’t smell the foreshadowing, it’s because of TV revenue. Well, that’s the biggest reason at least.  </p>
		<p>Conferences like the Big Ten and the Pac-12 had something the SEC did not - their own broadcasting network. So, in August of 2014, the SEC ‘followed the leader’ and finally debuted their own channel. Southeastern Conference Commissioner Mike Slive announced the SEC’s partnership with ESPN to create their own multi-platform network. At the time, this was the largest TV deal in college sports history.  </p>
		<p>According to the <a href="https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2013/05/the-southeastern-conference-and-espn-announce-new-tv-network-and-digital-platform/"> press release</a>, ESPN’s new channel would air “SEC content 24/7 including more than 1,000 live events in its first year.” It would also include original content from each school that would be available on its digital platforms.  </p>
		<p>As a result of this deal, in 2015 the SEC saw an increase of $1.5 million in their median revenue of sponsorships/advertising/licensing - their largest jump since 2008.  </p>

		<iframe title="SEC Median Revenue in Corporate Sponsorship, Advertising and Licensing" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-qtSG7" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qtSG7/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="541"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
		</script>

		<p>Professor Jodi Upton, the Knight Chair in Data and Explanatory Journalism, helped to start and has maintained this data of how college sports revenue is earned and spent. Upton helped put into words how monumental TV contracts have become. </p>
		<p>“It’s everything… there’s just so much money in the cable contracts. And these are all non-profits so the money has to go somewhere.” Upton said.</p>
		<p>The increase of sponsorships and TV revenue won’t stop here for the SEC. Currently, they are receiving $55 million from CBS to broadcast games. Three years from now, that will change. In December of 2020, Disney (which owns ESPN and ABC) won the bidding war to begin to broadcast all of the SEC’s college football games starting in 2024. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/10/sports/ncaafootball/sec-disney-deal.html"> According to the New York Times</a>, the deal is expected to give the SEC an annual payment of $300 million. Yes, you read that right. $300 million which is nearly six times as lucrative as the previous deal by CBS. As the old saying goes, the rich are getting richer.</p>
		<p>While the SEC is becoming an even greater powerhouse through TV deals, something still must be said about flat out having more fans than the other conferences. The slogan “it just means more” might actually be accurate when it comes to the fans in the south compared to everywhere else.  </p>
		<p>And it makes sense especially looking at things from a stadium capacity standpoint. <a href="https://www.ncaa.com/news/football/article/2018-07-30/25-biggest-college-football-stadiums-country"> According to the NCAA</a>, five of the top ten largest football stadiums in the country are in the SEC. On top of that, the SEC charges the most money per ticket out of all the conferences. Thus, making the SEC earn the most revenue in ticket sales. Many college football fans pay a lot of money to watch their team play - especially in the southeastern conference.  </p>

		<iframe title="The Rise, Fall and Consistency of Power Five Schools’ Median Ticket Revenue" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-TOKmO" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TOKmO/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="600"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
		</script>
		
		<p>As shown from the graph above, the SEC and Big Ten were side by side competing in ticket revenue in 2014. But while the Big Ten’s numbers plummeted the next two years, the SEC continued to increase to achieve the separation they have today. It’s also worth noting that 2014 was the last time the Big Ten had a team win the national championship in football. Since the conception of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the SEC leads all conferences with ten playoff teams. Behind them is the ACC and Big Ten at six, the Big-12 with four teams and the Pac-12 with three.  </p>
		<p>The SEC’s success in the last few years has set them up as the greatest conference in collegiate athletics. As if none of this were enough, they went out and stole two of the biggest colleges from the Big-12 and signed them to join the SEC. Powerhouses Texas and Oklahoma are set to join the Southeastern Conference in 2025.  </p>
		<p>Professor Upton explained the process for new teams to join the SEC is one that comes with high expectations.  </p>
		<p>“You're expected to have a certain number of seats, and be able to sell a certain number of tickets and have enough of a following that the conference wants you to be there,” Upton said. “If the conference agrees that you can hit those marks, then you’re in and you get a portion of that billion-dollar payout or whatever it is.”</p>
		<p>Texas and Oklahoma certainly are two teams that have enough “following” to be at any conference they wish, even the SEC. While Texas hasn’t seen their football program produce as many wins as decades before, they still bring in more revenue than scores of other college football programs.</p>
		<p>While the conference realignment is still years from now, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2021/07/26/college-football-if-sec-expands-could-match-ncaa-1-3-billion-revenue/5377990001/"> USA Today</a> estimates that in the fiscal year 2024-25, the SEC could be generating as much revenue as the NCAA itself. Let that sink. </p>
		<p>If it wasn’t evident enough, the entire landscape of college athletic conferences comes down to three things: money, money and money. The SEC has come a long way since 2013. Fueled by the emergence of their own TV broadcasting company, they’ve earned billions of dollars of revenue through sponsorships, ticket sales and countless other facets of college athletics.  </p>
		<p> What’s funny is that the money the SEC is gaining today will be like a mustard seed compared to ten years from now. Everything is changing fast and many things will be drastically different in the future. But, one thing is sure to remain constant - the southeastern conference as the dominating powerhouse in college sports.   </p>
